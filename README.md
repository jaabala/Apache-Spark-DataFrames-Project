# Apache-Spark-DataFrames-Project

As a Data professional, you need to perform an analysis by answering questions about some stock market data on Safaricom from the years 2012-2017.

We will perform the following:

# Data Importation and Exploration
1. Start a spark session and load the stock file while inferring the data types.
2. Determine the column names
3. Make observations about the schema.
4. Show the first 5 rows
5. Use the describe method to learn about the data frame

# Data Preparation

1. Format all the data to 2 decimal places i.e. format_number()
2. Create a new data frame with a column called HV Ratio that is the ratio of the
High Price versus volume of stock traded for a day

# Data Analysis
1. What day had the Peak High in Price?
2. What is the mean of the Close column?
3. What is the max and min of the Volume column?
4. How many days was the Close lower than 60 dollars?
5. What percentage of the time was the High greater than 80 dollars?
6. What is the Pearson correlation between High and Volume?
7. What is the max High per year?
8. What is the average Close for each Calendar Month?
